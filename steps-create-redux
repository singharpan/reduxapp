npm install redux react-redux

-------------------------Store Creation..................

import {createStore} from "redux"///in index.js

create store---->const store=createStore()

import {Provider} from "react-redux"

wrap "App" component with provider

initialize <provider> with store....<Provider store={store}

-------------------------------Reducer Creation------------------------
Only reducer have power to update state.

Reducer is passed as argument to store...i.e const store=createStore(reducer)

Reducer initialize data to "central store".....there can be more than one reducer possible

Reducer is basically a type of Function....a new "reducers" folder is created and new file "reducer.jsx" is initalized..

make reducer function and export it

reducer take (state,action) as argumnet.... reducer should have some initial data to initlaize store....

then reducer is imported and passed to store in "index.js 

....................Subscribe redux by Component............

now there is some initail data available in store 

to use that data by "App.js" ...this component need to subscribe to store

for that we need to ....import {connect} from "react-redux".....

now "connect" is wrapped to App component...connect return some Higher Order Component....

and HigherOrder componnet takes a component as argument

connect is wrapped to App component like....i.e  export default connect()(App);
